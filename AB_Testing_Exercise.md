## Questions
Yearly Plans are paid upfront upon purchase and Monthly plans are billed each month.  In this A/B test experiment letâ€™s assume that The **control** variant shows product A by default while **monthly_default** shows product C by default to new onboarding customers.

After conducting an A/B Test on the websiteâ€™s signupflow you are given the following results.

In this example letâ€™s say that:

ðŸ”µ is product A which has a recurring value of $200/Year

ðŸ”´Â is Product B which has a recurring value of $3000/Year

ðŸŸ Â is Product C which has a recurring value of $450/month (Paid monthly)

All 3 products are exclusive between each other meaning that if they purchase 1 they cannot purchase the other without cancelling their existing product plan.

Based on these results and to derive valuable insights for presentation to the leadership team.  Answer as best you can the following 2 questions.

1) What specific areas or aspects would you investigate to generate meaningful insights?

2) What conclusions or key findings do you anticipate reaching through your exploration?

*Clearly outline any assumptions you are making throughout this process, ensuring transparency in your analytical approach.*

## Answers
**Assumptions**

- Product C generates an annual revenue of approximately $5,400, making it the most financially rewarding among the three plans.
- The company aims to promote Product C through this A/B test.
- At first glance, Product C exhibits a 4% increase in adoption in the monthly_default variant compared to the control variant.
- Both variants showcase different default products, presumably on a landing page, prompting an exploration of user activity on that page.

**Question 1**

- Evaluate the sizes of the two variants as the chart presents only percentages. The goal is to ensure the monthly_default variant doesn't significantly reduce volumes
- Analyze the number and proportion of visitors to the landing page who did not subscribe to any plan in both variants. This goal is to verify that the monthly_default variant does not discourage customers who might otherwise adopt Product A.
- Compare the churn rates among subscribers to Product C and Product A. The goal is to avoid adopting Product C as the default plan if it leads to notably higher churn rates.
- Investigate the average time spent on webpages in both variants. Similar durations might provide insights into the significance of default plan placement for new customers during onboarding.
- Contrast the behavioral patterns of subscribers to Products C and A across both variants and identify any significant distinctions.
- Integrate demographic data to explore potential socioeconomic or other variances between subscribers to Products C and A.

**Question 2**

- Customers are more likely to select Product C if it's set as the default plan due to reduced friction, time, and effort required for the choice. Aligning the most profitable plan as the most convenient choice is recommended.
- Subscribers to Product C likely have higher disposable income compared to average Product A subscribers and may belong to a higher socioeconomic demographic.
- As a  next step, conduct an A/B test among a customer base with known economic status. Customizing default plan suggestions based on individual affordability, with an emphasis on marketing Product C, is advised when possible.
