## Question
Yearly Plans are paid upfront upon purchase and Monthly plans are billed each month.  In this A/B test experiment letâ€™s assume that The **control** variant shows product A by default while **monthly_default** shows product C by default to new onboarding customers.

After conducting an A/B Test on the websiteâ€™s signupflow you are given the following results.

In this example letâ€™s say that:

ðŸ”µ is product A which has a recurring value of $200/Year

ðŸ”´Â is Product B which has a recurring value of $3000/Year

ðŸŸ Â is Product C which has a recurring value of $450/month (Paid monthly)

All 3 products are exclusive between each other meaning that if they purchase 1 they cannot purchase the other without cancelling their existing product plan.
